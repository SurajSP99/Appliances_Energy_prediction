# Appliances_Energy_prediction
In this repository, I will be building a machine learning model for predicting the Energy Usage given temperature &amp; humidity values. 

# Dataset Features :

1) Date - Date & Time of logging of sensor data in YYYY-MM-DD-HOUR-MINUTE-SECOND format.
2) Appliance - Total energy used by appliances in Wh (Watt Hours). It is a dependent variable.
3) Lights - Energy used by light fixtures in house (in Wh)
4) T1 & RH1 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in kitchen area in deg. celcius & % respectively.
5) T2 & RH2 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in living room area in deg. celcius & % respectively.
6) T3 & RH3 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in laundry room area in deg. celcius & % respectively.
7) T4 & RH4 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in office area in deg. celcius & % respectively.
8) T5 & RH5 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in bathroom in deg. celcius & % respectively.
9) T6 & RH6 - Temperature & Relative Humidity outside the house in deg. celcius & % respectively.
10) T7 & RH7 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in ironing room in deg. celcius & % respectively.
11) T8 & RH8 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in teenager room 2 in deg. celcius & % respectively.
12) T9 & RH9 - Temperature & Relative Humidity in parent's room in deg. celcius & % respectively.
13) T_out - Temperature outside in deg. celcius (from Chievres weather station)
14) Press_mm_hg - Pressure in mm of Hg (from Chievres weather station)
15) RH_out - Relative humidity outside in % (from Chievres weather station)
16) Windspeed - Wind speed in m/s (from Chievres weather station)
17) Visibility - Visibility in km (from Chievres weather station)
18) Tdewpoint - Dew point temperature in deg. celcius
19) rv1 - Random variable 1
20) rv2 - Random variable 2
